# Tetris

I created this game between 2015 and 2016, in order to demonstrate the usage of my final undegrad project, a simple game library built using Java. This library uses Swing as its UI layer/rendering engine. 

I started to build this Tetris game in 2015, while I was studying in the USA. In 2016, after comming back to Brazil to finish my undergraduate studies, I decided to create a game library as my final undegrad project, and use this game to demo its features. 

I built it entirely alone. It is fully original, with no content copied from the internet.

## How to build

- Then run `ant`, in the root of this folder, in a terminal of your preference.
- Go to `/dist` and open `Tetris.jar`

## How to Play

- Move a piece with `A, W, D, S` or the `arrow keys`
- Rotate a piece with `E`
- Move a piece down faster by pressing the `space bar`
