# Tetris

I created this game in 2015~2016 to demonstrate the usage of my final undegrad project, a simple game library built solely using Java. This library uses Swing as the UI layer. I built it entirely alone and it is fully original with no content copied from the internet.

I started to built this game in 2015, while I was studying in the USA, and in 2016 I separated its core into a game library, and made it my final undegrad project.
